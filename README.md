An NMR simulation tool optimised for dense dipolar coupled networks

For pre-compiled binaries (strongly recommended), do refer to the [this webpage](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/chemistry/about-us/solid-state-nmr/research-profile/equipment-and-software/pnmrsim/).
The links in this page are sadly broken, but a zip file containing all the files can be downloaded from [this page](https://www.dur.ac.uk/paul.hodgkinson/pNMRsim).

This repository is the bleeding edge source code, currently a maintenance version of V18.05.13.

If compiling from source, you will first need to compile the support library, which is now also [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/dch0ph/libcmatrix).
