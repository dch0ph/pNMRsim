# pNMRsim
An NMR simulation tool optimised for dense dipolar coupled networks

For pre-compiled binaries (strongly recommended), do refer to the [project webpages](https://www.dur.ac.uk/paul.hodgkinson/pNMRsim).

This is the bleeding edge source code, currently a maintenance version of V18.05.13.

If compiling from source, you will first need to compile the support library, which is now also [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/dch0ph/libcmatrix).
