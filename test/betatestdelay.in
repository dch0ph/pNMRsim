# expect to see: 
#	static Iz amplitude .5 for 20ms, 
#	transition to Iz amplitude 0 in 10ms, 
#	static Iz amplitude 0 for 20ms, 
#	transition to Iz amplitude -.5 in 10ms 
#   Static Iz the until the end of 102.4ms acq duration /or above sequence repeats to fill the acq time. 

# attempt 2 bellow might work if the 0 amplitude pulses did not produce the Undefined: BlockedMatrix<T>::row error.
